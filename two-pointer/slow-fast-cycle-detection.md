### Review

For details, see [Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection#Floyd's_Tortoise_and_Hare). The idea is fabulous, and the key insight here is that: suppose T and H start at s, starting point of cycle is u, and eventually they will meet at v, then v must be divisible by the length of cycle.

#### idea

It is tricky to treat this problem as cycle detection.
