#### Review

If you meet questions in which the order of node's values matters, in some probability, monotonic stack could be useful. Increasing/decreasing stack might be the most fitted approach to solve next greater/lesser questions.   More detail, see [mono-stack][../stack/mono-stack.md]



#### 654. Maximum Binary Tree

##### idea

By finding out position of maximum node, it can be easily solved by recursive approach. However, after a close investigation, we can decompose it into a next greater problem. Given example [3,2,1,6,0,5], 3's next greater is 6,
